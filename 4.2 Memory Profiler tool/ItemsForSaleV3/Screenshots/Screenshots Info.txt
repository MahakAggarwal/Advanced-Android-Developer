There are 2 images given - 

1. ItemsForSaleV1_MemoryProfiler.PNG --> this image is screenshot of memory profiler of the ItemsForSale project. Here, the thumbnail images are small sized.

2. ItemsForSaleV3_MemoryProfiler.PNG --> this image is screenshot of memory profiler of the ItemsForSaleV3 project. Here, the thumbnail images are large sized.

Notes
When comparing the two screenshots, the following notes come to mind - 
1. When small images are used as thumbnails, less amount of memory is used by the app when compared to large images. There is not much of a visible difference.
2. The initial numbers from the graph suggest that there are no visible memory leaks in each of the apps.
