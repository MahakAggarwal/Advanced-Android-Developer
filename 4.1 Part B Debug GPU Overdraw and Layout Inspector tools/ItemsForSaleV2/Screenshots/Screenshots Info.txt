There are three screenshots provided - 
1. Profile_GPU_thumbnails.png --> This is screenshot of app when profile GPU rendering is on and the recyclerview has small sized images as thumbails

2. Profile_GPU_largeImages.png --> This is screenshot of app when profile GPU rendering is on and the recyclerview has large sized images as thumbails

3. GPU_Overdraw_thumbnails --> This is screenshot of app when GPU Overdraw is on and the recyclerview has small sized images as thumbails


NOTES

1. The bars are higher when large images are used. This means that the system takes more time to load the large images into the recyclerView. There is not much of a visible difference when large images and small images are used in the recyclerView. 

2. GPU overdraw shows that there are not many areas with red overdraw.
